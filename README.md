# DataStructure-Algorithms
This project included Leetcode questions from 1 to 600. Every question is written in Java and time complexity and space complexity are analyzed at the top of the page.
The purpose is to help people learn Leetcode problems and data structure more efficiently. I hope these notes save you time.
